## Retry, single thread (2026-10-23)

`./gradlew :benchmark:jmh -Pjmh="RetryBenchmark -prof gc"` — source: `benchmark/src/main/java/dev/resilience4cata/benchmark/RetryBenchmark.java`.

**Setup:** JMH 1.37, JDK 21.0.10, Apple M1 laptop, 3 forks × 5 × 1 s warmup × 5 × 1 s measurement, `-Xms1g -Xmx1g`. Both libraries: 3 attempts, zero delay, no jitter, every exception retried, no event listeners. The failure is a preallocated, stackless exception, so neither library pays for creating it.

| Scenario | Baseline (no library) | resilience4cata 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT | Resilience4j 2.4.0 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| First attempt succeeds | 1.14 ± 0.13 ns | **1.55 ± 0.08 ns**, 0 B/op | 12.61 ± 0.10 ns, 0 B/op |
| Fails once, then succeeds | 3.03 ± 1.43 ns | **7.50 ± 0.75 ns**, 0 B/op | 411.6 ± 15.1 ns, 16 B/op |
| Same, Resilience4j without its `Thread.sleep(0)` | — | — | 38.8 ± 3.6 ns, 16 B/op |

**Overhead over the baseline:**
- Success path: about **0.4 ns** for resilience4cata vs **11.5 ns** for Resilience4j.
- One retry: about **4.5 ns** vs **36 ns** for Resilience4j's retry machinery alone, or **409 ns** as Resilience4j behaves by default.

**Reading these numbers:**
- Resilience4j 2.4.0 calls `Thread.sleep` between attempts even when the delay is zero (verified in its bytecode). That accounts for most of the 411 ns. The `NoSleep` variant removes it with Resilience4j's own `RetryImpl.setSleepFunction`, to isolate the cost of the rest.
- This is a best case for Resilience4j: one decorated supplier, so the JIT sees a single type at every call site and escape analysis removes its per-call objects on the success path. Real applications decorate many methods. The research predicts larger differences with a polluted JIT profile ([03 §7.4](research/03-performance-internals.md)); that scenario is not measured yet.
- Single thread only. Retry has no shared mutable state, so contention is not expected to matter for it; it will for the circuit breaker and rate limiter.
- One laptop, one JDK. Pending: JDK 25, x86-64, polluted profile.
